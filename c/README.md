# Prerequisites
- LibcURL, see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/. Preinstalled on OSX, easy to
  install on linux and compatible with Windows. MIT licensed.

# Selecting a JSON parser
- JSMM is very low-level and simple. Seems interesting. Parsing takes quite a
  bit of code though. 
- cJSON. MIT license.
- ABL JSON wraps around cJSON.
- Jiffy. Clean interface, plain site. BSD-like license?
